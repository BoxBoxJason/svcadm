## Usage

### psqladm

**psqladm** is a wrapper script designed to manage a PostgreSQL container. It provides various commands to set up, manage, backup, and restore PostgreSQL databases using Docker containers. The script allows you to automate common PostgreSQL operations and manage containers more effectively.

#### Commands
- `setup`: Sets up a PostgreSQL container with persistent storage and starts it. This command initializes the required Docker volumes and network settings.
- `add_database`: Adds a new database to the running PostgreSQL container. This command is useful for initializing new projects or environments.
- `backup`: Backs up a specific database from the PostgreSQL container to a designated backup directory. The backup files are stored in the `$POSTGRESQL/backup` directory by default.
- `stop`: Stops the running PostgreSQL container without removing any data or configuration. This command is useful for temporarily halting operations.
- `resume`: Resumes the PostgreSQL container from a stopped state, allowing you to continue operations without loss of data.
- `cleanup`: Removes the PostgreSQL container and all associated Docker volumes and network settings. This is a destructive action and will delete all stored data.
- `status`: Checks and displays the status of the PostgreSQL container, indicating whether it is running, stopped, or not present.

#### Environment Variables
To use the `psqladm` script, several environment variables need to be configured:
- `POSTGRESQL`: This environment variable should point to the path where PostgreSQL-related data and configurations are stored. This path is used to store backups and credential files.
- `POSTGRESQL_CONTAINER_NAME`: Specifies the name of the PostgreSQL Docker container. This name is used to identify and manage the container.
- `SERVICES_NETWORK`: Defines the Docker network in which the PostgreSQL container will be placed. This network should be preconfigured or set up during the `setup` command.

#### Customization
- **Version**: The default version of the PostgreSQL image used in the container is `postgres:15`. To change the version, modify the line `IMAGE_NAME="postgres:15"` in the script.
- **Backup Directory**: The default backup directory is set to `$POSTGRESQL/backup`. To change this, edit the `BACKUP_DIR="$POSTGRESQL/backup"` line in the script.
- **Credentials**: The default superuser for the PostgreSQL container is `postgres`, and its password is generated randomly during setup. This password is stored in a file within the credentials directory, which is defined by `CREDENTIALS_DIR="$POSTGRESQL/.credentials"`. To change the path where credentials are stored, update this line in the script.

#### Dependencies
- **Docker**: Ensure Docker is installed and running on your machine. The script uses Docker commands to manage the PostgreSQL container and related resources.

### safeguard

**safeguard** is a utility script designed to continuously monitor directories for malware and automatically quarantine any suspicious files. It uses the `clamscan` command to perform malware scanning and `inotifywait` to monitor directories for changes. Any new files added to the monitored directory are scanned for malware, and if any threats are detected, the files are moved to a quarantine directory for further analysis.

#### Setup
If you plan on using the `safeguard` script without customizing it, ensure that the following steps are completed:
1. Install the `clamav` package on your system to provide the `clamscan` command.
2. Install the `inotify-tools` package on your system to provide the `inotifywait` command.
3. Set up the logrotation for the safeguard log file to prevent it from growing indefinitely.
  You can create a logrotate configuration file for the safeguard log file by creating a new file in `/etc/logrotate.d/safeguard` with the following content:
```
/var/log/scan/safeguard.log {
    monthly
    missingok
    rotate 12
    compress
    notifempty
    create 640 YOUR_USER YOUR_GROUP
}
```
4. You can add the script to your cron jobs to start the process at boot time, ensuring safeguarding of your directories as long as your machine is on. To do this, add `@reboot /usr/bin/zsh -c "source /home/YOURUSER/.zshrc && safeguard start"` to your crontab
  
#### Commands
- `start`: Starts the safeguarding process. This command initiates monitoring of the specified directory (or directories) for any new files and scans them for malware. If a file is detected as infected, it is moved to a quarantine directory.
- `clear`: Stops the safeguarding process and removes all files created by the safeguard command, including logs and quarantined files. This command is useful for resetting the safeguard environment.
- `status`: Checks and displays the current status of the safeguarding process, indicating whether monitoring is active or stopped.
- `directory <directories>`: Allows the user to specify a custom directory (or multiple directories) to safeguard. Note that the monitoring stops at reboot and you will need to start the safeguarding process again.

#### Customization
- **Quarantine Directory**: To change the default directory where infected files are quarantined, modify the `QUARANTINE_DIR="$HOME/.quarantine"` line in the script.
- **Monitoring Directory**: To change the default directory being monitored, modify the `WATCH_DIRS=("$HOME/Downloads" "$HOME/Documents" "$HOME/Music" "$HOME/Pictures" "$HOME/Videos")"` line.
- **Log Directory**: The default log directory is set to `/var/log/scan`. To change this, edit the `LOG_DIR="/var/log/scan"` line in the script.
- **Log File**: The default log file is set to `safeguard.log`. To change this, modify the `LOG_FILE="safeguard.log"` line in the script.

#### Dependencies
- **clamscan**: A command-line antivirus scanner that is part of the ClamAV suite. Ensure `clamscan` is installed and properly configured on your system.
- **inotifywait**: A command-line utility that watches for changes to files and directories using Linux's inotify interface. Ensure `inotifywait` is installed on your system.

#### Example Usage

```bash
# Start the safeguarding process to monitor the default downloads directory
.safeguard start

# Specify a custom directory to monitor for malware
safeguard directory /path/to/custom/directory

# Check the status of the safeguarding process
safeguard status

# Clear all quarantine files and stop the safeguarding process
safeguard clear
```
